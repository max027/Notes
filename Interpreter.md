# Phases of compiler 
1. lexical analysis(Scanning)
2. Syntax analysis(Parsing)
3. Intermediate representations
4. Optimization
5. Code generation

## Types of compiler
1. Single-pass compiler
2. Tree walking interpreter
3. Transpilers
4. Just-in-time compiler

# compiler and interpreter
* Compiling is an implementation technique that involves translating a source language to some other—usually lower-level—form. When you generate bytecode or machine code, you are compiling. When you transpile to another high-level language, you are compiling too.
* When we say a language implementation “is a compiler”, we mean it translates source code to some other form but doesn’t execute it. The user has to take the resulting output and run it themselves.
* Conversely, when we say an implementation “is an interpreter”, we mean it takes in source code and executes it immediately. It runs programs “from source”.
