# Version control
* Version control - also known as source control or revision control - is an important software development 
practice for tracking  and managing changes made to code and other files.

* A repository is a collection of files and directories that are stored together. 
* the staging area is the middle ground between what you have done to your files (also known as the working 
directory) and what you had last committed (the HEAD commit). 
* As the name implies, the staging area gives you space to prepare (stage) the changes that will be reflected 
on the next commit.

## types of versin control
* Centralized version control
* Distributed version control
