# Theory 
* In fact despite their awesome complexity human brains like mine, and yours, are fundamentally flawed. In the jargon they are subject 
to cognitive  biases which result in irrational behaviour. 

* our brains are loaded with baggage from the distant  

* In contrast prospect theory says we take more risks in a losing position to get even, but we want less risk when winning, 
preferring a quick and certain gain to a chance of losing our profits.

* pack-testing is an invaluable tool for creating new trading rules

## Gamblers anonymous
* There appear to be three main factors associated with the most addictive games. 
    - Firstly there should be an illusion of control, which encourages the perception of skill.
    - Secondly, the game should include apparent near misses; frequent chances of almost winning the biggest prize.
    - Finally, the game should be rapid and continuous to give a constant flow of stimulation. 

* Creating a purely objective system is a powerful commitment mechanism.

## STANDARD DEVIATION
* The standard deviation is a measure of how dispersed some data is around its average; it’s a measure of risk
* One unit of standard deviation is also sometimes called a sigma.
*  distribution is just a way of describing the pattern of your data.


# Systamatic trading rules
* data first, is to analyse some data, find some profitable patterns and create some trading rules to exploit them.
This is sometimes called data mining.

* The alternative, ideas first, is to come up with an idea, then create a rule, which is then tested on data to see if 
it works.

* Whether you are using systematic rules or making discretionary forecasts it’s important to understand where your 
returns are coming from and what your ‘edge’ is – if any. 

## SHARPE RATIO (SR)
* The Sharpe ratio (SR) measures how profitable a trading strategy or holding an asset has been, or is expected to be.

* Strictly speaking you should take the ‘excess’ return over and above a risk free interest rate,26 although this isn’t
relevant for a trader using derivatives,27 nor as important in the post 2009 low interest rate era as it was before.

* Formally it is the mean return for a particular time period divided by the standard deviation of returns for the same 
time period. 

## SKEW
* Where an asset has a higher chance of a large down move than an equivalent upmove, it is said to have a negative skew. 

* If large up moves are more likely then it has positive skew.

## Risk
* predictable risk as being equal to the recent historic level of the standard deviation of percentage daily changes 
in price

* Be aware that if you are making steady profits nearly every day, and most of your trades are winners, then there is a 
good chance you are engaged in negative skew trading. 

## VOLATILITY STANDARDISATION
* This is adjusting the returns of different assets so that they have the same expected risk
