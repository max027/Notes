# Backend Development
Sometimes called the server side, the backend of your application manages your web application's overall functionality. When your user interacts with the frontend, the interaction sends a request to the backend in HTTP format. The backend processes the request and returns a response.

When your backend processes a request, it usually interacts with the following:
- Database servers to retrieve or modify relevant data
- Microservices that perform a subset of the tasks your user requested
- Third-party APIs to gather additional information or perform additional functions
# Port
A port in computing is a communication endpoint used for sending and receiving data between devices, processes, or applications.

# Route
routes define how a server should handle incoming requests based on the URL path and HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST). They are crucial for building web applications and APIs.

# Middleware
Middleware are software tools that act as intermediaries between different applications, systems, or services, facilitating their communication and interaction. 

# Mongodb
## What is ORM?
ORM is Object Relational Mapping, basically a technique to query or perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to the database, mainly RDBMS (Relational Databases), using an object-oriented paradigm.

* With the help of ORM, you donâ€™t actually need to use SQL at all. You can directly interact with the database and perform queries in the same language you are using for your back-end code!

## What is ODM?
ODM is Object Document Mapping. It is like an ORM for non-relational databases or distributed databases such as MongoDB, i.e., mapping an object model and NoSQL database (document databases, graph database, etc.).
