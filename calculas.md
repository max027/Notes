# Functions and limit
Functions arise whenever one quantity depends on another.
* A function f is a rule that assigns to each element x in a set D exactly one element, called f(x), in a set E.
It’s helpful to think of a function as a machine.If x is in the domain of
the function f, then when x enters the machine, it’s accepted as an input and the machine produces an output f(x) according to the rule of the function. Thus we can think of the
domain as the set of all possible inputs and the range as the set of all possible outputs.

## Representations of Functions
There are four possible ways to represent a function:
● verbally (by a description in words)
● numerically (by a table of values)
● visually (by a graph)
● algebraically (by an explicit formula)

* The Vertical Line Test A curve in the xy-plane is the graph of a function of x if and only if no vertical line intersects the curve more than once.
* If a function f satisfies f-x) = f(x) for every number x in its domain, then f is called an even function. For instance, the function f(x)=x^2
 is even because  f(-x)=(-x)^2=f(x)

##  Increasing and Decreasing Functions

Let \( f: D \to \mathbb{R} \) be a function defined on a domain \( D \subseteq \mathbb{R} \).

### Increasing Function
The function \( f \) is **increasing** on an interval \( I \subseteq D \) if  
$$
\text{for all } x_1, x_2 \in I, \text{ if } x_1 < x_2 \text{ then } f(x_1) \leq f(x_2).
$$
If the inequality is strict (\( f(x_1) < f(x_2) \)), then \( f \) is **strictly increasing**.

### Decreasing Function
The function \( f \) is **decreasing** on an interval \( I \subseteq D \) if  
$$
\text{for all } x_1, x_2 \in I, \text{ if } x_1 < x_2 \text{ then } f(x_1) \geq f(x_2).
$$
If the inequality is strict (\( f(x_1) > f(x_2) \)), then \( f \) is **strictly decreasing**.


# Mathematical model : A catelog of essential function
A mathematical model is a mathematical description (often by means of a function or an equation) of a real-world phenomenon such as the size of a population, the demand
for a product, the speed of a falling object, the concentration of a product in a chemical reaction, the life expectancy of a person at birth, or the cost of emission reductions

## linear model
When we say that y is a linear function of x, we mean that the graph of the function is a line, so we can use the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line to write a formula
for the function as. y= f(x)=mx+b

## polynomial function
A function P is called a polynomial if
$$
f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \dots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0
$$
where:

- \( n \) is a non-negative integer (the degree of the polynomial),
- \( a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n \) are real coefficients,
- \( a_n \neq 0 \) (leading coefficient),
- \( x \) is the variable.

## Transformation
Vertical and Horizontal Shifts Suppose c . 0. To obtain the graph of
y − f(x)+c, shift the graph of y − f(x) a distance c units upward
y − f(x)- c, shift the graph of y − f(x) a distance c units downward
y − f(x-c), shift the graph of y − f(x) a distance c units to the right
y − f(x+c), shift the graph of y − f(x) a distance c units to the left
